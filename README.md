**Stock Price Prediction for Pharmaceutical Companies During Covid-19**

**Overview**

In the year 2020, rise in COVID-19 cases and the anticipation of fully functional vaccines led to fluctuations and increase in the stock prices of the pharmaceutical companies. The main aim of this project is to predict and forecast the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies that worked on developing the COVID-19 vaccines and verify the impact of external factors such as public sentiments and stock prices of competitor companies on the stock prices of the company.

**Data description**
To create the dataset, manually downloaded the stock prices of the major pharmaceutical companies that developed the vaccines. Based on the research, the prominent companies that took the initiative to develop the vaccines in 2020 were Pfizer, AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax. I downloaded the stock prices of these companies for the year 2020 from YFinance and combined the data.

**Solution**

To forecast the stock prices, I have used LSTM and Bi-LSTM for all the above mentioned companies.
